\item 78\% accurate subject identification with hashtag matching. 
\end{tightemize}  

\runsubsection{Drone-Path}
\descript{| Drone Scheduling Algorithm }
\location{ Feb 2020 | Algorithm Development }
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed Drone Scheduling Algorithms for an NP-Hard problem.
\item Idea implementation of Greedy \& Clustering based Algorithms based on Fuel locations along with ANN for algorithm selection.
\item Initial 10\textsuperscript{6} tests were performed on both algorithms while simultaneously training the ANN. Rest were done on ANN output.
\item Observed an 89\% accuracy on algorithm selection (ANN).
